thinks grapple is kinda stiff
expected the knockback to be more intense
"your obstacle placement looks way more intimidating than it actually is"
actively trying to use projectiles and lasers to bounce through obstacles
animated fan has collision
fix tiles in polarity unlock
wishes there was a bit more telegraphing for the lasers
everyone has failed transferring grapples at even level in polarity unlock
being thrown off by lasers firing with different pulse patterns
wishes the shield was a hold not a press, but recognizes that would kinda break the game
"i wish the bullets would just kill me"
"very relieving to be able to switch between them"
"the shield is really cool as a metroidvania because i can just breeze through to where i need to go"
ping ponged through bullet webs in final room, spammed
"my thoughts? its fucking cool"
the two shields especially was fun for traversal 
smoother controls, theyre good but momentum feels a bit off
thinks the game would feel better if getting hit reset you to a checkpoint, like celeste or super meat boy
fighting being bounced around is frustrating

# Mechanics

- Standard movement
- Jump / Dash
	- Dash and jump use same charges
		- This limits movement to either one jump, or a dash on the ground.
		- Charges reset on landing, with a minimum cooldown (likely half a second, just enough to slow down repeat dashing
	- Starting state has no charges
	- torso has one charge, only usable on ground
	- Legs gives two charges, can be used in air
		- Allows double jump, combining dash and jump, or two dashes off a ledge
	- Possible third charge as secret upgrade?
- Grapple
	- Shoots in a straight line with a maximum range
	- four or eight directional
	- Primarily used as a substitute for a ranged weapon, for puzzles before platforming
	- Ideas:
		- Grapple does not auto pull, character stops falling / freezes in place, can press a second button to pull itself towards the grapple point, or jump
		- Different grapple points have different effects, such as a charged point resetting your dash charges, a hackable point moving an object in the world
- "Ikaruga" shield
	- Red/blue polarity
	- starts with a single polarity, and it turns off automatically when using some other ability (like the dash) to give the player a chance to familiarize with the power-up
	- eventually, the player gains the other polarity and the shield no longer turns off
- Damage
	- No death or health
	- Being hit by the wrong polarity stuns you, forcing you to fall.
		- No input would work for some time
		- either a second or so to allow you to recover, or until you hit the ground?

"I expected momentum to hold midair"
Seems to have a little difficulty managing momentum
Got to grapple unlock quickly, thinks the button is 5 not s
MAstered grapple way faster than the first playtester
Thinks the verticle pipes could be stood on
Having some difficulty on the three grapples in the path to dash
Likes the way i forced him to learn how to retract and extend grapple 
Keeps forgetting that he needs to change direction to grapple, wasn't sure if it was required
HAd some difficulty with the three horizontal lasers
Assummed he couldn't go through the blue laser door
Attenuation on the first laser in dash to central column should be a bit higher 
CEnter column second floor, the two lasers alternating on the hanging platform, change the timing of the second one to be closer to the first
Bullets sometimes push people into the correct spot, they haven't commented so i don't know if this is good bad or neutral
Thinks getting stunned is awkward, mostly due to loss of control and unpredictable nature of being knocked around. This instead of being killed is still more forgiving, and likes the general idea. Says he thinks it might be made better if you kept some level of control during a stun, which I think is something we could explore in a future version of the game.
